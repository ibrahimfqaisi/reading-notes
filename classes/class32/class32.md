## Q1 :What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?
Django Rest Framework (DRF) implements a comprehensive permissions system to enhance API security:

User Authentication: DRF supports multiple authentication methods, such as BasicAuthentication and TokenAuthentication. These mechanisms validate user identity before granting access to secure views and resources.

Access Control: DRF permissions establish strict rules for user actions, like read, write, update, and delete, on specific API resources. This ensures that only authorized users with the necessary privileges can perform these actions.

Predefined Permission Classes: DRF provides a set of built-in permission classes like AllowAny, IsAuthenticated, and IsAdminUser. Each class offers distinct access control levels to accommodate various use cases.

Tailored Access Rules: Developers can design custom permission classes in DRF, meticulously tailored to their application's unique requirements. This level of control enables precise and granular access management.

##  Q2 In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

In SQL, the purpose of the SELECT statement is to retrieve data from a database table. It allows you to specify which columns or expressions you want to retrieve, as well as any filtering or sorting criteria.

To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees,' you would use the following SQL query:
```
SELECT *
FROM employees;
```

## Q3 Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?
DRF Generic Views simplify the creation of RESTful APIs by providing pre-built classes for common operations. They reduce repetitive code and ensure consistency in API design. Here's an example of using DRF Generic Views to build a RESTful API for a 'Book' model:

RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView: Handles retrieving, updating, and deleting a single 'Book' instance.

```


from rest_framework.generics import RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView
from .models import Book
from .serializers import BookSerializer

class BookDetailUpdateDeleteView(RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
```
