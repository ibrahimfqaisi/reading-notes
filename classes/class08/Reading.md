# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It consists of nodes, where each node references the next node in the stack. The main operations performed on a stack are:

- `push`: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
- `pop`: Removes the top item from the stack.
- `peek`: Views the top item without removing it.
- `isEmpty`: Checks if the stack is empty.

Stacks are commonly used for tasks that require a specific order of processing, such as function call stacks, undo-redo operations, and expression evaluation.

## Queues
A queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. It consists of nodes organized in a linear fashion. The primary operations on a queue include:

- `enqueue`: Adds an item to the rear of the queue.
- `dequeue`: Removes the item from the front of the queue.
- `peek`: Views the front item without removing it.
- `isEmpty`: Checks if the queue is empty.

Queues are commonly used for tasks that involve sequential processing, such as task scheduling, breadth-first search, and buffer management.

Both stacks and queues serve essential roles in various algorithms and applications, providing efficient and ordered data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
