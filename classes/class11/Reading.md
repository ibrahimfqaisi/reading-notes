  - **Interactive**: Jupyter Lab is an interactive environment, so you can run code and see the results immediately.
  - **Extensible**: Jupyter Lab is extensible, so you can add new functionality with extensions.
  - **Flexible**: Jupyter Lab is flexible, so you can configure it to fit your needs.
- Some differences between Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook include:
  - **User interface**: Jupyter Lab has a more modern user interface than Jupyter Notebook.
  - **Panels**: Jupyter Lab supports multiple panels, which allows you to work with multiple notebooks, files, and other resources at the same time.
  - **Extensions**: Jupyter Lab can be extended with a variety of extensions, which can add new functionality to Jupyter Lab.

**Q2: What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?**


- NumPy provides a powerful multidimensional array object called ndarray. ndarrays are fast, efficient, and easy to use.
- Some main functionalities provided by the NumPy library include:
  - **Linear algebra functions**: NumPy provides a comprehensive set of linear algebra functions, including matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, and eigenvalue decomposition.
  - **Random number generators**: NumPy provides a variety of random number generators, which can be used to generate random numbers for a variety of purposes.
  - **Scientific computing functions**: NumPy provides a variety of functions for scientific computing, including integration, differentiation, and optimization.
- NumPy is particularly useful for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks in Python programming due to its efficiency, convenience, and wide range of mathematical functions.

**Q3: Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.**


- NumPy arrays are multidimensional arrays with multiple axes or dimensions.
- Properties of NumPy arrays include:
  - **Shape**: The shape of an array is the number of elements in each axis.
  - **Size**: The size of an array is the total number of elements in the array.
  - **Data type**: The data type of an array is the type of the elements in the array.
