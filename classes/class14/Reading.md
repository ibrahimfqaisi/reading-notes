# Question 1
## What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases?

- Matplotlib: A comprehensive library for creating various visualizations. It can be complex to learn and use.
- Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides an easier interface and attractive default styles. Beginner-friendly and produces high-quality plots.
- Bokeh: A library designed for interactive visualizations in web browsers. Useful for creating interactive plots that can be shared and manipulated by users.

# Question 2
## In Seaborn, what are the main functions for creating relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain their purposes.

- Relational plots: Functions like `regplot()`, `scatterplot()`, and `pairplot()` explore relationships between variables. For example, `regplot()` creates a scatter plot with a regression line to examine correlation.

- Categorical plots: Functions like `countplot()`, `barplot()`, and `violinplot()` visualize categorical variables. They show the distribution of categories. For instance, `countplot()` displays category frequency.

- Distribution plots: Functions like `distplot()`, `kdeplot()`, and `rugplot()` visualize the distribution of continuous variables. They help understand data shape and spread. For example, `distplot()` creates a histogram to analyze value distribution.

# Question 3
## What is the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet for Python developers, and what are its key sections?

The Seaborn Cheat Sheet is a valuable resource for Python developers working with Seaborn. It provides a quick reference for the library's functions and features, making usage more efficient.

Key sections in the cheat sheet include:

- Table of contents: Organized structure for easy navigation.
- Function list: Summary of Seaborn functions for quick access.
- Examples: Practical code examples demonstrating plot creation.
- Notes: Additional tips and explanations to enhance understanding and usage.

The Seaborn Cheat Sheet simplifies developers' workflow, enabling them to leverage Seaborn's capabilities effectively and save time.
