### 1- What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?
In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.

### 2- Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself until it reaches a base case.
### 3- What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.
Pytest fixtures provide reusable test data and state setup for tests, while code coverage measures how much of the code is exercised by the tests. Using fixtures and code coverage together can improve the quality and maintainability of a project by ensuring that all code is tested and tests are efficient to write and maintain.
