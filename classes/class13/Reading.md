**Q: Can you explain the concept of linear regression and its purpose in machine learning and data analysis?**

A: Linear regression is a technique used in machine learning to predict a continuous value based on independent variables. Its purpose is to model the relationship between variables and make predictions.

**Q: How do you implement a linear regression model using Python's Scikit Learn library?**

A: To implement a linear regression model using Scikit Learn, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import the LinearRegression class from the `sklearn.linear_model` module.
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```
2. Create an instance of LinearRegression.
```python
model = LinearRegression()
```
3. Fit the model to the training data using the fit() method.
```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
4. Make predictions using the predict() method.
```python
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
## Q: What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does it contribute to evaluating a machine learning model's performance?
A: Splitting the dataset into train and test sets helps evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. The purpose is to simulate how the model performs on unseen data. By training the model on the train set and evaluating on the test set, we can estimate its ability to generalize. It helps detect overfitting and provides an unbiased evaluation. Metrics calculated on the test set, such as accuracy or mean squared error, provide insights into the model's performance on new, unseen data.
