### 1- What is the purpose of the ‘with’ statement when opening a file in Python, and how does it help manage resources while reading and writing files? 
The 'with' statement in Python is used to ensure that a file is properly closed after its usage, which helps manage resources while reading and writing files.

### 2- Explain the difference between the ‘read()’ and ‘readline()’ methods for file objects in Python. Provide examples of when to use each method?
The 'read()' method reads the entire contents of a file into a single string, while the 'readline()' method reads one line at a time. 'read()' is typically used when you want to read the entire contents of a file, while 'readline()' is used when you want to read one line at a time.

### Briefly describe the concept of exception handling in Python. How can the ‘try’, ‘except’, and ‘finally’ blocks be used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code? Provide a simple example?
Exception handling in Python is a way to deal with errors or unexpected events that may occur during program execution. The 'try', 'except', and 'finally' blocks are used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code. 'try' encloses the code that may raise an exception, 'except' handles the exception, and 'finally' is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, and it is typically used to release resources.
