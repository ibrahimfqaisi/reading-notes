Q: What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?

A:
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enable software applications to communicate with each other.
- In Python applications, APIs can be used to access and manipulate data from external sources such as web services or databases.
- APIs are accessed by making HTTP requests to API endpoints using libraries like `requests`.
- Python applications can use APIs to fetch data, send data, perform actions, and integrate different services.


Q: What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?

A:
- The Requests library in Python simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests to APIs.
