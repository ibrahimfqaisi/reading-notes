## Purpose of Dunder Methods:
The purpose of dunder methods in Python is to allow objects to emulate the behavior of built-in types and interact with the language's features. One commonly used dunder method is __init__, which serves as a constructor method to initialize objects when they are created. For example:


```class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
person = Person("John", 30)
print(person.name)  # Output: John
print(person.age)   # Output: 30
```

## Ethical Issue in "AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course" video:

The main ethical issue raised in the video concerns the misuse of developers' work without proper attribution or consent. The AI guru allegedly used the developers' work to create a paid course, presenting it as their own without giving credit or obtaining permission. This raises concerns about plagiarism, intellectual property rights, and dishonesty. To avoid such ethical issues, the AI guru could have sought permission, given credit, and collaborated or licensed the developers' work.

## Python Statistics Module and Example Function:
The Python statistics module is a part of the Python Standard Library and provides functions for statistical operations. One example function within this module is mean(), which calculates the arithmetic mean of a sequence of numbers. Here's an example:

```
import statistics

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean_value = statistics.mean(data)
print(mean_value)  # Output: 3
```
In the example above, the mean() function from the statistics module is used to calculate the mean value of the data list, which is 3.
