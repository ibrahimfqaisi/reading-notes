# Reflection on My Learning Today

Today, I had the opportunity to learn several new things in Python, and I would like to share my thoughts on what I have learned.

1. I learned how to create a virtual environment in Python. This allows me to create an isolated environment for each of my Python projects, which helps me manage dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects.

2. I learned about the difference between running a module and running a script in Python. A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements, whereas a script is a file containing Python code that can be executed directly. Understanding the difference between these two concepts is important when working with Python.

3. I also learned how to write a small app in Python. This was a great opportunity for me to put my Python skills into practice and apply what I learned about creating virtual environments and running modules and scripts.
