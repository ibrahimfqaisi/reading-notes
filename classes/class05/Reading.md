### What are linked lists, and how do they differ from arrays?

Linked lists are a type of linear data structure that allow for dynamic memory allocation, meaning that they can grow or shrink in size and don't require a set amount of memory to exist. They are made up of nodes that are linked together using pointers to form a chain-like structure, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.

Arrays, on the other hand, are a type of linear data structure that require contiguous memory allocation. This means that all of the elements in an array must be stored together in a single block of memory. Arrays are static data structures, meaning that they require a set amount of memory to be allocated when they are created, and this amount cannot change dynamically. If more elements are needed than the allocated memory can hold, a new array must be created and the elements copied over.

Overall, the main difference between arrays and linked lists is that arrays are static data structures that require contiguous memory allocation, while linked lists are dynamic data structures that allow for non-contiguous memory allocation.
