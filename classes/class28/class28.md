## Q1: How do Django Forms facilitate user input handling, and what are some key components of creating a form using the Django framework?

Django Forms simplify user input handling by providing an abstraction layer. Key components of creating a form in Django include defining form fields, validating input, rendering HTML forms, and handling form submission.

## Q2: Explain the purpose of Django Templates in web development and describe how template inheritance can be utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability.

Django Templates separate presentation logic from business logic. Template inheritance allows code reusability by defining a base template with common elements and creating child templates that inherit from it.

## Q3: Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.

Django Views handle HTTP requests and determine the server's response. Function-based views (FBVs) are simple functions that directly control request and response processing. Class-based views (CBVs) provide a structured and reusable approach with built-in functionality and support for code reusability and modular design.
