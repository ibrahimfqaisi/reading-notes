# Introduction_to_SQL


In SQL, the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN commands are used to retrieve, add, modify, and remove data from a database. SQL Lesson 13-15 cover these commands in detail, demonstrating how to insert new rows into a table, update existing rows, and delete unwanted data. SQL Lesson 16-18 focus on managing the structure of the database by creating new tables, modifying existing ones, and deleting unnecessary tables.
