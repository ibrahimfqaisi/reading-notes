## Data Structures

Data structures are a way to organize and store data in computer programs. They allow for efficient access and manipulation of data. There are various types of data structures, including:

### Linked List

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list. Linked lists are useful for dynamic data structures, where the size of the data can change during program execution.

### Array

An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Elements in an array can be accessed using an index. Arrays are useful for static data structures, where the size of the data does not change during program execution.

### Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. The hash function takes a key as input and produces an index into an array of buckets, where the value can be stored. Hash tables are useful for fast data access, as the lookup time is constant on average.

### Stack and Queue

Stack and queue are data structures that store a collection of elements. In a stack, the elements are stored in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. In a queue, the elements are stored in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. Stacks and queues are useful for managing program flow and data processing.

### Graphs and Trees

Graphs and trees are data structures that represent a collection of nodes and their relationships. In a graph, nodes are connected by edges, while in a tree, nodes are connected by branches. Graphs and trees are useful for modeling complex systems and algorithms, such as network routing and search algorithms.


## Discussion Questions:

### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

When selecting a data structure to solve a particular problem, it's important to consider the expected operations that will be performed on the data. Different data structures are optimized for different types of operations. Additionally, the expected size of the data and memory constraints of the system should also be considered. By analyzing these factors, you can select a data structure that maximizes performance and efficiency.

### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, it's essential to define a base case that will eventually be reached. Additionally, the recursive function should be making progress towards the base case with each recursive call. Recursive functions are useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems, and a base case ensures that the function terminates, preventing an infinite recursion that could lead to a stack overflow error.
