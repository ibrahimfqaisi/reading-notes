# Measuring Emotional Intelligence

I scored a 19 on the four components of Emotional Intelligence. Although this is a good score, I understand that there is always room for improvement in this area. It's worth noting that any score below 18 indicates an area where improvement is needed. Therefore, I plan to seek feedback from others and work on developing my empathy, self-regulation, social skills, and motivation through various strategies such as mindfulness, active listening, and building strong relationships. By doing so, I hope to become more effective in personal and professional relationships and enhance my overall well-being.

# Assessing Bias

Based on my score of 105 in the Bias Self-Assessment, it seems that I have a high level of self-awareness, curiosity, and courage when it comes to addressing unconscious biases. However, I also recognize that this is an area where there is always room for improvement, and I want to continue to develop my skills and knowledge.

One new insight that I gained from taking this assessment is that there are eight different areas of unconscious bias, and I scored differently in each one. This has helped me to better understand my strengths and weaknesses in this area, and I plan to focus on the three or four areas where I scored the lowest in order to improve my overall performance.

Overall, I believe that taking the Bias Self-Assessment was a valuable exercise that has given me a better understanding of my abilities and areas for improvement when it comes to addressing unconscious biases. I look forward to continuing to learn and grow in this area in the coming weeks and beyond.
