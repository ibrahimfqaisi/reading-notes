### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?


The one thing I bring to this career and a potential employer that nobody else can is my insatiable curiosity when faced with coding problems. I approach each issue with a desire to understand its cause and learn how to prevent it from happening again in the future. This curious mindset sets me apart from others and allows me to efficiently solve problems and succeed in a programming career.


### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
**Firstly**, I will make sure that I fully understand the problem and what is causing the issue. This might involve going back to the documentation, checking my code for errors, or doing some research online to gain a deeper understanding of the issue.

**Secondly**, I will create a plan of attack to address the problem. This could involve breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts, or creating a step-by-step approach to tackle the issue.

**Finally**, I will divide and conquer the problem by focusing on one small piece of the puzzle at a time. This will allow me to make incremental progress towards a solution and avoid feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of the issue.

By following these three steps, I believe that I will be able to "un-stick" myself and find a way to solve even the toughest coding problems.
